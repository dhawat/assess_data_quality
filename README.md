### Introduction
> Data is what guides today's decision making process, it is at the center of modern institutions, but according to the saying : GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out), bad data may have detrimental consequences on the company that used it. It is then of crucial order that the data be of best quality possible, however, the process of cleaning the data usually relies on deterministic rules, which makes it hard, tedious and time consuming. Thus AMIES along with the company Foyer proposed a challenge about the automation of the process. This leads us to propose plug-and-play algorithms that need as little as possible of human intervention. 

`Assess data quality` is a project that allows for
  - Fully automated code for the evaluation of data quality. 
  - Proposes several strategies to detect "bad data".

### Installation

You can add this repository on your local machine using git commands:

- if you considered [forking the repository](https://github.com/)

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/put_name_here
  ```

- if you have **not** forked the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/
  ```

### Brief overview of the folder

The folder contains .py and .ipynb files containing the functions that we propose and some tests that we have run, along with a presentation (.pptx file) of the work and functions that were used.
