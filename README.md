# improved_data_quality
This github repo contains the data and works on the challenge de mathematiques et entrepris 2021:  https://challenge-maths.sciencesconf.org/
# some useful git command
The folder code will contains the file .py and .ibynb
The folder report will contains the latex repo as file .tex (please do not add .pdf unless picture to prevent conflict).
You can add this repo on your local machine using: git clone <url>
