The experts affirm that the preprocessing phase takes 50% to 70% of the  
total time of the knowledge discovery process

Important terms : Correctness, Consistency, Completeness and Currency.

### Data quality degradation
- **Noise**: errors contained in the data. Datasets with a large amount of noise can  
have a detrimental impact on the success of classification task, e.g., reducing the predictive ability  
of a classifier.
- **Missing values**: refers to missed of values of an attribute, and typically occurs due to faults in the  
process of data recollection, e.g, data transfer problems, sensor faults, incompleteness in surveys,  
etc. 
- **Outliers**: considered as a distant observation from other observations . An outlier can be an  
inconsistent value or abnormal behavior of the measured variable .  
- **High dimensionality**: is referred to datasets with a large number of variables. The variables can  
be categorized as: relevant, irrelevant, or redundant . With the presence of a large number of  
features, a learning model tends to overfit, resulting in their performance degenerating .  
- **Imbalanced class**: is considered when a dataset exhibits an unequal distribution between its  
classes . When a dataset is imbalanced, the approximation of the misclassification rate  
used in learning systems can contribute negatively to decrease the accuracy and the quality of  
learning.  
- **Inconsistency**: refers to duplicate instances with different class labels .  
- **Redundancy**: in classification tasks, this is referred to as duplicate records .  
- **Amount of data**: corresponds to the total of available data for training a classifier ; this DQ  
issue is highly related with high dimensionality. Large datasets with a high number of features  
can generate high dimensionality, while small datasets can build inaccurate models.  
- **Heterogeneity**: defined as data incompatibility of a variable. This occurs when data from different  
sources are joined .  
- **Timeliness**: corresponds to the degree of representation of the real world through data in  
a required point in time .
